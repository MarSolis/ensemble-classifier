ensemble-classifier
===================

R; Ensemble-based classifier

An ensemble-based classifier is a classifier that combines multiple base supervised classifiers
for a final classification. A base classifier can be any kind of supervised classification, like artificial
neural networks (ANNs), random forest (RF) or support vector machines (SVM). The main idea behind
this methodology is to weigh several individual classifiers, and combine them in order to obtain a
classifier that outperforms every one of them.
